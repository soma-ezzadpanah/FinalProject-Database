# FinalProject-Database


# Introduction
In this document, I will explain how I set up a developed environment on a Mac for a Python-based web application using Flask and MySQL. The application also involves basic HTML for the frontend.
## Tools and Technologies Used
- IDE (Terminal on Mac Laptop)
- Python – downloaded in Terminal
- Flask – Installed in Terminal
- MySQL – Downloaded in Terminal
- HTML

# Creating the Project
Opening the terminal application in Mac operating system, I created a folder Final_Project. In terminal created my database. I then created a python file app.py. In that I created my flask application in python programming language. Then I created a folder named template, which consisted of all the HTML files.
Starting the Flask Application
- Open terminal
- Navigating to the folder Final_Project.
- Compiling the program:
  - export FLASK_APP=app.py
  - export FLASK_ENV=development
- Running the flask:
  - flask run #This command started a local development server, and the application was accessed by going to the link: http://127.0.0.1:5000 in the web browser.
- To stop the server, I typed ‘CTRL+C’.

# Conclusion
With the steps I have included above, I had a functional development for building a web application with Flask and MySQL on macOS. This allowed me to develop, test, and refine my application locally.
